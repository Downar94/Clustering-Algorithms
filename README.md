# Clustering-Algorithms

The set of algorithms for Cluster Analysis (Clustering). Clustering is the technique that aims to grouping set of objects (data points). The objects in one group are more similar to each other, than to objects in another group. Technically speaking, Clustering is the Machine unsupervised learning method used for grouping unlabeled data and main method for the statistical data analysis. There are plenty of clustering algorithms with are based on the different clustering models. For my purpose i have used the most popular ones, including:

- Agglomerative Hierarchical

- Mean-Shift

- K-Means

- DBSCAN

## Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
